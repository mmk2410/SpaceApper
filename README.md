# SpaceApper

**A [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/) add-on**

Add webpages to the Thunderbird spaces toolbar.

*Attention: The author has no experience in creating a add-on for Thunderbird. Therefore, the add-on should not be considered stable.*

## Installation & Usage

At the moment I consider the add-on to be too unstable for publishing in the Thunderbird Add-On Marketplace. Therefore, a manual installation is required. You can follow the step outlined in the [documentation](https://git.mmk2410.org/mmk2410/SpaceApper/wiki/Installation).

Additional to the installation there is [further documentation](https://git.mmk2410.org/mmk2410/SpaceApper/wiki) available.

## Issues and Code Contribution

The main repository is hosted on my Forgejo instance and publicly accessible there at [git.mmk2410.org/mmk2410/SpaceApper](https://git.mmk2410.org/mmk2410/SpaceApper). Additionally, I created mirrors on [GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/mmk2410/spaceapper) and [GitHub](https://github.com/mmk2410/SpaceApper).

Since my own Forgejo instance has no open registration, you may submit issues or pull/merge request at any of the mirrors (so either GitLab or GitHub) and I will take care of them (as time allows, of course). This will be the case at least until at least [federation](https://forgefed.org/) of issues is implemented in Forgejo.

Regarding code contribution: Please make sure you read and accepted the license.
